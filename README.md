“Ex-PVP pangenome reveals signatures of modern sorghum breeding ”

Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) is a climate-resilient cereal crop widely grown for grain, forage, and bioenergy. While the reference (BTx623) genome has been foundational, it fails to capture the full extent of gene content and structural variation in sorghum.
To address this, we constructed a long-read-based pangenome using 46 elite line - U.S. ex-Plant Variety Protected (ex-PVP), uncovering gene presence–absence variations (PAVs), structural variants (SVs), and selective sweeps linked to modern agronomic traits.
